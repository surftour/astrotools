Subject: agn spectrum, attenuation, etc

Hi all,


	So, for the paper compiling the quasar luminosity function  
measurements that just came out, I had to go back into the guts of  
how we were modeling the agn spectrum, etc. Anyways, as a by-product,  
I've written some expanded versions of the attenuation code, agn  
spectrum code, and another code to dump the QLF (either bolometric or  
in arbitrary bands) from the combined observations etc. in this  
recent paper. So I though you all might be interested in the codes.

	For each of the three codes (attenuation, agn_spectrum,  
qlf_calculator), there's a c-code (which should be entirely self- 
contained), with it's own makefile, and an IDL script that's set up  
to call the code (each such IDL script has one line at the very  
beginning of the script pointing it to where the executable is, so  
just change that to wherever you compile it).

	I tried to comment the overhead on each pretty thoroughly (in  
the .pro files for attenuation and agn_spectrum, and in the .c file  
mainly for the qlf file), but feel free to ask me about it. Major  
bullet points:

attenuation:
	I borrowed liberally from Brant's version of the code to do the  
proper splitting of the Morrison & McCammon photoionization cross- 
sections into metal-free and metals components which (obviously)  
scale with metallicity differently. This version of the code adds a  
simple flag to use either SMC-like, LMC-like, or MW-like dust curves  
for the attenuation. It also adds a more detailed treatment of  
Compton-thick cross-sections (it uses the transmission curves asa  
function of NH from Matt, Pompilio, & La Franca 1995, decomposed into  
metal-free & metals components). also has a flag to return the  
integrated attenuation over the soft or hard X-ray bands instead of  
at a specific frequency.

agn_spectrum:
	this one is re-written from scratch b/c in the QLF paper we adopt a  
number of improvements over Marconi et al. 2004. the code will let  
you call either the Marconi-esque spectrum, the template spectrum we  
build in the QLF paper, or the mean Richards et al. 2006 spectrum.  
The primary difference between the marconi-like spectrum and the more  
recent one is the lack (in the marconi spectrum) of a hot dust bump  
-- as noted in the comments and as brant pointed out last week,  
whether you want to include this really depends on your application.  
if you want a typical bolometric correction, you should include the  
bump (i.e. use the QLF paper spectrum). if you are trying to model  
that IR re-emission and believe the simulations can capture it, of  
course use the input spectrum without it. the QLF paper spectrum also  
includes a more detailed treatment of the continuum shape. I would  
only recommend using the Richards et al. spectrum if you want to  
compare with the results of assuming a constant (luminosity- 
independent) bolometric correction, as the proper corrections do  
depend on luminosity (but if you do make this comparison, the  
richards et al. template has fewer biases than the elvis et al. 1994  
template). you can use the keyword SDSS to overlay the vanden Berk et  
al. template optical spectrum over any continuum (it uses a  
reasonably robust sliding continuum division and addition to overlay  
it). you can also just return the integrated luminosity in various  
bands. finally, i say marconi-esque b/c I've actually substantially  
modified the marconi et al. template. a couple small changes to the  
input spectral slopes and X-ray input parameters based on more recent  
determinations, and a different scaling of optical-to-xray adopted  
from more recent (and statistically more appropriate) measurements.  
the effects are usually subtle, but are very important for the  
bolometric corrections of the highest-luminosity X-ray sources.

qlf_calculator:
	the comments here are in the c-code. basically, give it luminosities  
& redshift & it gives you the QLF, bolometric or in any band you  
specify. you can use the different fits from the QLF paper, although  
it will default to the full best-fit model.

pretty much all the inputs to the idl scripts can be arbitrary  
vectors or scalars (it won't dump out b/c you do or don't give it a  
large grid, for example).

cheers,
- phil

PS - If anyone has issues with contour_lum or its cousins (the NH  
code, etc), let me know, I've got the version vetted against all the  
stuff elizabeth has thrown at it.
