This distribution contains the MGE_FIT_SECTORS package described in
Cappellari (2002, MNRAS, 333, 400).

It consists of a set of IDL procedures to be used to compute a
Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) photometric model starting from one
or more images of a galaxy.

To start using this package read the Getting Started guide in the
PDF file readme_mge_fit_sectors.pdf.

The following IDL routine is also required, but it is *not* included
in this distribution and should be downloaded separately:
