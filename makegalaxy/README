code: makegalaxy

A tool for the generation of numerical galaxy models.  This code has a ~20 year
history, starting with Lars' original ideas, through Volker Springel's modification
and additions, and finally additional edits by Patrik Jonsson and T.J. Cox.  You
can find documentation in Hernquist (1993), Springel & White (1999), Springel 2000,
and Springel, Di Matteo, & Hernquist (2005).  All of the more recent changes,
e.g., different gas distributions, the use of the Eddington formula to estimate the
distribution function, and the ongoing work to include halo gas and accomodate the
construction of dwarf galaxies is not uniformly documented anywhere.  Hopefully
this situation will change soon.

input: a parameter file, see examples in the parameterfiles subdirectory.

output: IC files appropriate for Gadget/Arepo.

syntax: ./makegalaxy <parameterfile.txt>

        This information will be returned when the code is run without any
        parameters.

installation: standard autotools used for setup.  The following is a generic
        set of commands to build the code.  Please adjust CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to
        accomodate the details of your system, but keep the H5_USE_16_API flag.

        autoreconf -fiv
        export CFLAGS='-g -O2 -I/usr/local/hdf5/include -DH5_USE_16_API'
        export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/hdf5/lib
        ./configure
        make
