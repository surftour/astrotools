astrotools
==========

This repository contains (or did contain - as of Aug 2013 several items were removed at the request of ex-collaborators, but feel free to contact me and I can put you in touch with peole that have them) a mixed bag of numerical tools useful for the generation, evolution, visualization, and analysis of theoretical galaxy models, i.e., the complete "toolkit" developed during my days as an astrophysicist.

Includes the following:

idlstuff = analysis and visualization scripts 

snpa* = useful tools to look at simulated (or constructed) snapshot files

(stuff removed owing to petty academic worries)

gadget = my version of gadget.  the core numerical simulation code.

makegalaxy = code to generate n-body realizations of compound galaxies.

flexcombinegalaxies = tool to flexibly combine two galaxies/snapshots.
