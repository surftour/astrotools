==========

This repository contains a mixed bag of numerical tools useful for the 
generation, evolution, visualization, and analysis of theoretical
galaxy models, i.e., the compete "toolkit" developed and during my days
as an astrophysicist.

Includes (or will include) the following:

gadget = my version of gadget.  the core numerical simulatiosn code.

makegalaxy = code to generate n-body realizations of compound galaxies.

flexcombinegalaxies = tool to flexibly combine two galaxies/snapshots.

idlstuff = analysis and visualization scripts 

snpa* = useful tools to look at simulated (or constructed) snapshot files
