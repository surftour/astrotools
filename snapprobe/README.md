astrotools
==========

A mixed bag of numerical tools useful to generate, evolve, analyze, and visualize model galaxies (like our own Milky Way).  This was the complete "toolkit" during my astrophysics days ... which were long ago, and thus, this stuff is pretty out of date at this point.  Sorry.

Includes the following:

idlstuff = analysis and visualization scripts 

snpa* = useful tools to look at simulated (or constructed) snapshot files

simulate_it = a/my version of the core numerical simulation code

make_it = generate n-body realizations of compound galaxies.

combine_it = combine two galaxies/snapshots
