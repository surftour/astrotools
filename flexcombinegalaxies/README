code: flexcombinegalaxies

A tool for the flexible combination of numerical galaxy models, specifically
those made by makegalaxy.  This should now be considered the standard tool
for the combination of galaxies, i.e., it will now replace combinegalaxies.
This code can affix galaxies upon a Keplerian orbit with adjustable ellipticity,
or via manually setting the position and velocity of each galaxy.

input: A parameter file that lists two Gadget/Arepo IC files, e.g., those 
       generated by makegalaxy, and details of their combination.

output: IC files appropriate for Gadget/Arepo.

syntax: ./flexcombinegalaxies <parameterfile.txt>

        This information will be returned when the code is run without any
        parameters.

installation: standard autotools used for setup.  The following is a generic
        set of commands to build the code.  Please adjust CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to
        accomodate the details of your system, but keep the H5_USE_16_API flag.

        autoreconf -fiv
        export CFLAGS='-g -O2 -I/usr/local/hdf5/include -DH5_USE_16_API'
        export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/hdf5/lib
        ./configure
        make
